# Hi! I'm Alice

### Let me introduce myself...
Born and raised in Italy, I eventually decided to move north and discovered a lovely city called **Aachen**, in Germany. This is where I’ve been living for the past five years and where I continue to grow and develop personally and professionally.

Sometimes the rainy showers make me dream of sunnier, southern places — but Germany definitely has its bright sides!

I’m a media designer with a background in digital and print, currently expanding my skills in web development. I have experience working with WordPress, UX/UI design, and creative content, and I’m passionate about building user-friendly digital experiences.

Here are my **main skills**:

- 🖼️ Media Design

- 💻 WordPress Website Creation

- 👤 UX/UI Design

- 📱 Responsive Web Design

- 🎨 Visual & Creative Content Creation

- 🌈 Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, XD, After Effects, Premiere Pro)

- 🌐 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, MongoDB)

- 🌎 Multilingual Communication (Italian, German, English)
